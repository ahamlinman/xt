This is a binary release of https://github.com/ahamlinman/xt, a cross-format
translator for serialized data formats, including the following contents:

  - xt is the executable itself. Try "./xt --help" for a usage summary.

  - xt.1 is the xt manual page. Try "man ./xt.1" to read it.

  - LICENSES.html provides copyright licenses and source code links for xt and
    the third-party software it incorporates.

On macOS, you may need to allow xt in the Privacy & Security section of
