/// The set of input and output formats supported by xt.
///
/// The feature sets of the supported formats vary along two key dimensions.
///
/// Formats supporting **multi-document translation** can represent multiple
/// independent "documents" within a single input stream. For example, xt can
/// translate a single YAML file with documents separated by `---` markers into
/// a stream of newline delimited JSON values. In contrast, single document
/// formats may only represent one logical "document" per input stream. When
/// translating an input with more than one document to a single document output
/// format, xt will return an error as it starts to translate the second
/// document in the stream.
///
/// Formats supporting **streaming input** can translate a multi-document input
/// stream without first buffering the entire stream into memory. This enables
/// translation of unbounded input sources, such as an upstream program emitting
/// an event stream to xt through a pipe. Formats that do not support streaming
/// must buffer the entire input stream into memory before translating the first
/// document.
///
/// Support for each data format comes largely from external Rust crates, with
/// only minor additional preprocessing from xt for select formats. Note that
/// the crate selection for each format is **not stable**, and is documented for
/// informational purposes only.
