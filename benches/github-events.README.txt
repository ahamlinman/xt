The GitHub events corpus is based on a test file from the json-iterator
project: https://github.com/json-iterator/test-data. For TOML compatibility,
I've removed null values from the data and moved the top-level array into the
"events" key of a top-level map. For distribution efficiency, I've translated
the data to MessagePack with xt and compressed it with zstd. Across all xt
formats, the input expands to around 23 - 28 MB in size after decompression
and translation.
